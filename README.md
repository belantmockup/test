For JICT, measuring KPIs (Key Performances Indicators) or Dashboards to improve operational efficiencies and productivity is crucial. The best way to evaluate the relevance of a KPI is to use the SMART criteria. SMART are stands for,

* Specific 
* Measurable 
* Attainable
* Relevant
* Time-bound.


However, selecting high-quality KPIs isn’t easy, so when the time comes, use these five conditions to determine the best key performance indicators (KPIs) for your organization.

* Is your objective Specific?
* Can you Measure progress towards that goal?
* Is the goal realistically Attainable?
* How Relevant is the goal to your organization?
* What is the Timeframe for achieving this goal?
